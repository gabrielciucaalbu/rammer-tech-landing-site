# Self-improvement and collaboration rules

PR hygiene

- Keep PRs small, focused, and well-described
- Include before/after snippets for non-trivial refactors
- Link related Tasks/bugs; mention breaking changes explicitly

Commit message conventions

- Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat(web)`, `fix(web)`, or `chore(web)`
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` followed by optional Task reference
- The `(web)` scope indicates landing site changes
- Examples:
  - `feat(web): add hero section animation (Task 123456)`
  - `fix(web): correct locale redirect loop`
  - `chore(web): update Cursor rules documentation`
- Keep descriptions concise and in imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- For breaking changes, add `!` after scope: `feat(web)!: change i18n routing structure`

Cursor usage

- Always load `.cursor/rules/*` when generating changes
- Ask for conflicts if rules and code diverge; prefer repo patterns
- Propose incremental edits; avoid wide, unrelated formatting diffs

Feedback loop

- If a rule causes friction, propose a change in a dedicated PR with rationale
- Prefer measurable improvements (build time, test coverage, defect rate)

Documentation

- Add/adjust JSDoc / TSDoc comments and README excerpts when introducing new patterns
- Keep examples minimal and representative of the codebase
