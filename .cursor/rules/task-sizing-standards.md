When creating Tasks for ClickUp, use the following guidelines to determine level of effort.

1
- Trivial task that is clearly defined and self-contained
- Low complexity with no or basic logic
- Very low risk, no dependencies

2
- Non-trivial task that requires some reasoning or decisions
- Low complexity logic with minimal variation
- Low risk with little to no coordination required

3
- Multi-step task with moderate scope
- Moderate complexity with conditional or layers logics
- Potential risk; may require alignment

5
- Difficult, multi-step tasks with moving parts
- Cognitively complexity with interconnected logics
- Medium to high risk due to potential impacts or unknowns

8
- High difficultly task with high ambiguity or coordination
- Multiple components with logically complex
- Very high risk due to unknowns, assumptions or impact radius

13
- Break into smaller Tasks; complexity is too high
