# Cursor rules for rammer-tech-landing-site

Purpose

- Guide Cursor to follow this repository's architecture and project conventions.
- Prefer small, scoped edits. Keep PRs focused and readable.

Project overview

- **Rammer Tech landing / marketing site** built with Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript.
- Supports two locales: Romanian (`ro`) and English (`en`).

Architecture

- **Next.js App Router** with a `[lang]` dynamic segment for i18n (`src/app/[lang]/`).
- **Server Components by default** — only add `"use client"` when the component genuinely needs browser APIs, event handlers, or hooks.
- Pages are thin orchestrators: fetch data / dictionary, compose sections, pass props down.

i18n pattern

- Locale detection runs in `src/middleware.ts` (uses `negotiator` + `@formatjs/intl-localematcher`).
- Translation strings live in `src/dictionaries/ro.json` and `src/dictionaries/en.json`.
- Use `getDictionary(lang)` from `src/dictionaries/get-dictionary.ts` to load translations in Server Components.
- Always propagate the `lang` param from layout / page down to child components that need translated text.

Styling

- **Tailwind CSS v4** utility-first approach.
- **shadcn/ui** components installed in `@/components/ui` (new-york style, Radix UI primitives, Lucide icons).
- Use `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for component variant definitions.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) to merge class names.

Animations

- Use **Framer Motion** for entrance animations, scroll-triggered effects, and interactive transitions.
- Keep motion values and variants co-located with the component that uses them.

File structure

- `src/app/[lang]/` — pages and layouts (App Router)
- `src/components/` — shared / reusable components
- `src/components/ui/` — shadcn/ui primitives (auto-generated, avoid manual edits)
- `src/dictionaries/` — i18n JSON files and helper
- `src/lib/` — utility functions (`utils.ts`, etc.)
- `public/` — static assets (images, SVGs)

Component conventions

- Co-locate components near their usage when they are page-specific.
- Extract to `src/components/` only when reused across multiple pages / sections.
- Prefer composition over prop-heavy monolith components.
- Name files in kebab-case (`hero-section.tsx`), export components in PascalCase (`HeroSection`).

Coding practices

- Use `@/` path aliases for all imports (configured in `tsconfig.json`).
- Prefer React Server Components; mark `"use client"` only when necessary.
- Avoid `any`; use proper TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Keep images optimized; use `next/image` for automatic optimization where applicable.

Operating constraints

- This is a landing / marketing site. There is no backend API or database in this repo.
- Follow project conventions and team standards. If a rule here conflicts with an existing pattern in this repo, prefer repo patterns.
